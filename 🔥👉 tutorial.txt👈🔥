# Running the Script in Termux, Brevent, or Qute

Here's a step-by-step guide for running the performance optimization script in each of the supported terminals:

## In Termux:

1. **Install Termux** from the Google Play Store or F-Droid if you don't have it already
2. **Open Termux** and create a new file:
   ```
   nano red-magic-optimizer.sh
   ```
3. **Copy and paste** the entire script into the editor
4. **Save the file** by pressing Ctrl+O, then Enter, then Ctrl+X
5. **Make the script executable**:
   ```
   chmod +x red-magic-optimizer.sh
   ```
6. **Run the script**:
   ```
   ./red-magic-optimizer.sh
   ```

## In Brevent:

1. **Install Brevent** from the Google Play Store
2. **Open Brevent** and navigate to its terminal interface
3. **Create a script file** in your device storage (you might need to do this using a file manager first)
4. **Copy the script** to a location accessible by Brevent
5. **Navigate to the script location**:
   ```
   cd /path/to/script/
   ```
6. **Make it executable**:
   ```
   chmod +x red-magic-optimizer.sh
   ```
7. **Execute the script**:
   ```
   ./red-magic-optimizer.sh
   ```

## In Qute:

1. **Install Qute Terminal** from the app store
2. **Launch Qute** and open a new terminal session
3. **Create a new script file**:
   ```
   nano red-magic-optimizer.sh
   ```
4. **Paste the entire script** into the editor
5. **Save and exit** the editor
6. **Set execution permissions**:
   ```
   chmod +x red-magic-optimizer.sh
   ```
7. **Run the script**:
   ```
   ./red-magic-optimizer.sh
   ```

## Additional Tips:

- The script will automatically check if you're running it in an appropriate terminal
- Make sure to keep the terminal app running (or at least in the background) for continuous optimization
- To stop the script, return to the terminal and press Ctrl+C
- After a device restart, you'll need to run the script again if you want to reapply the optimizations
